        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What being a responsible person means</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">We need details of a responsible person when you’re setting up your payment service provider (PSP), Stripe on GOV.UK Pay. This is so that Stripe can run the required anti-money laundering checks.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Liability stays at an organisational, and not individual level.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can be a responsible person</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your responsible person can be anybody who has the authority to sign contracts on the organisation’s behalf.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">While there is no rule about the seniority of the responsible person, they must be:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>trusted with the responsibility</li>
          <li>senior enough to have access to customer files and records</li>
          <li>able to decide independently if they should report suspicious activities or transactions</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Some example positions that have held this role include head of specialist accounting, corporate customer relations manager or service director (finance).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An external consultant can not be your responsible person.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The information needed</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We usually need to know the responsible person’s:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>name</li>
          <li>home address</li>
          <li>date of birth</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If Stripe can’t verify their identity, you may be asked to provide a photocopy of an identity document, for example their passport or driving licence.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We need this information so our payment service provider, Stripe can run anti-money laundering checks. They have a legal obligation to make these checks.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You cannot submit the responsible person’s work address. Stripe needs the home address in order to check their identity.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What checks are run</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Our payment service provider, Stripe needs to run:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>electronic identity verification</li>
          <li>sanctions screening</li>
          <li>politically exposed person (PEP) screening</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your responsible person will not see a hard search or footprint on their credit report from these checks.</p>
