          Using GOV.UK Pay to take and process payments for the police force
        </h1>

        <p>The government is creating a template website and backend system for all UK police forces to use. It’s called the Single Online Home (SOH). The SOH will allow the public to access police services across the UK in a consistent way.</p>
        <p>As part of this, all police forces will use GOV.UK Pay to take online payments for their services, starting with firearm licences.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">About GOV.UK Pay</h2>
        <p>GOV.UK Pay is a free and secure online payment service for government and public sector organisations.</p>
        <p>GOV.UK Pay provides customer-facing pages to take card payment details from users and the back-end system to process and view transactions. We use a payment service provider (PSP) to take the money out of the user’s account and deposit it into your account.</p>
        <p>We comply with the <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/security/">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)</a>. You can also access our privacy policy from your account.</p>
        <p>You can read more about GOV.UK Pay on our <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/">product</a> and <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/features">features page</a>. Or <a href="https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register">sign up</a> for a test account and try it for yourself.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Payment service providers (PSPs)</h2>
        <p>You’ll need a contract with a Payment Service Provider (PSP) to process the payments taken using GOV.UK Pay. There are 2 ways to get a PSP.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-small">1. Use GOV.UK Pay's Payment Service Provider, Stripe.</h3>

        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>you don’t have to procure your own PSP, saving you time and money</li>
          <li>account set up is quick and easy</li>
          <li>you can start taking payments immediately</li>
          <li>you’re not locked into a long-term contract with a PSP</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Find out more how to use <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/payment-service-provider/">GOV.UK Pay’s PSP, Stripe</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-small">2. You can also use GOV.UK Pay if you have a contract with:</h3>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>Worldpay Corporate Gateway (if you have another gateway account with Worldpay, you’ll have to switch to the Corporate gateway to use GOV.UK Pay)</li>
          <li>Barclays ePDQ</li>
          <li>Barclays Smartpay/Adyen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Account set up for PSPs takes 4 to 6 weeks. Procuring your own PSP can take between 2 to 6 months. You can procure these PSPs using the Crown Commercial Services framework.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Contract</h2>
        <p>You’ll need to sign a contract with GOV.UK Pay before you can take payments. If you choose to use our PSP, you’ll need to sign the Connected PSP Account Agreement too.</p>
        <p>Once the contracts are signed, you can also use GOV.UK Pay to take payments for other services you provide.</p>
        <p>In order to download and review the contracts, you’ll need to go to <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/">https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/</a> and either sign in or sign up for a test GOV.UK Pay account.</p>

        <p>Once you are signed in to your account you can download the:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li><a href="https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/policy/download/contract-for-non-crown-bodies">GOV.UK Pay contract</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/policy/download/stripe-connected-account-agreement">Connected PSP Account Agreement</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The contracts are linked from the page footer.</p>
        <p>The Single Online Home transition team will work with you to connect your live account to the SOH firearms licence platform.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Custom branded payment pages</h2>
        <p>You can add your own branding to payment pages and emails. </p>
        <p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/optional_features/custom_branding/#custom-branding-of-payment-pages">instructions to set up your custom branding</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Payment reference number</h2>
        <p>The Single Online Home system will generate an application reference number to associate with the payment. This will enable you to reconcile the application with the payment.</p>
