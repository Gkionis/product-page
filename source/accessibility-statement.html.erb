      <p class="govuk-body">This service is fully compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this service</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We last tested this service for compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA on 5 September 2019. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We used this approach to deciding on a sample of pages to test.</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>We used <a class="govuk-link" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> to audit each page for accessibility issues.</li>
        <li>We used <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wave.webaim.org/">Wave</a> to automatically test for accessibility issues on pages that do not need users to sign in.</li>
        <li>We tested transactions in each type of user journey on GOV.UK Pay, checking each page as we went along.</li>
        <li>We tested the GOV.UK Pay product pages and a sample of documentation pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We tested:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>our main website platform, available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk">https://www.payments.service.gov.uk</a></li>
        <li>our payments account platform, available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk">https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk</a></li>
        <li>our credit card payment platform at https://card.payments.service.gov.uk</li>
        <li>our direct debit payments platform at https://directdebit.payments.service.gov.uk</li>
        <li>our payment links platform at https://products.payments.service.gov.uk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We know that if you take too long to submit information on a form, you will not receive a warning message or be able to extend your time.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We conducted an accessibility review in 2016 and found that setting a 90-minute timeout  was more helpful for users with accessibility needs than a warning message. However we plan to do more research on this from October 2019.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This page was prepared on 19 September 2019. It was last updated on 19 September 2019.</p>
